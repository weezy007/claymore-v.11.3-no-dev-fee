claymore dualminer v11.3 without developers fee

This is v11.3 of Claymore Ethereum Miner without DevFee and without any loss in the hashrate!

The "EthDcrMiner64.exe" is patched. You don't have to do anything, just start mining with the usual .bat

Once devfee mining is triggered it will mine to your address instead of developers. To make sure everything is working properly check the mining .txt logs for any "eth_submitLogin" where your address doesn't appear. If there are any then restart mining again and it should work properly. Otherwise contact me.

Claymore claims he detects hacks, which will cause the real hashrate to got down.

## It runs undetected!
You will see your effective hashrate calculated from the submitted share go up. Try yourself.

## FAQ
Having issues with the Windows Defender?

-If you dont trust the default .bat file, create your own .bat file. Alternatively set an exception for the icnluded .bat file.

Will it work for future releases of Claymore ?

-No I will have to update the releases manually.

Lower Hashrate than with original Claymore?

-Please run it for at least 12-24h, to make up for the downtime when you sitched to the no fee version and even out the usual volatility.

-Why would I remove Claymore’s developer fee and share it?

Claymore software has a fixed fee of 1% for ETH. For dual mining it's 1.5%. While I am all for supporting claymore for his awesome program, there are a few problems with it: The fee works in a way that each hour you will be disconnected from your pool for about 1-2 minutes. You will instead mine for the Claymore developers. After this it will reconnect to your pool. This repeated disconnecting and reconnecting cools down and heats up your GPU over and over again. I argue this to negatively impact the life of your GPU’s.Also, sometimes one of the GPU’s would even reset to the default clock settings because of the constant disconnecting/reconnecting or it would “hang” and crash the miner. This also causes to recreate the DAG file. In short, you end up loosing precious time, and way more time than the claimed 1-1,5%! I am thankful for the Claymore software, but I think there could be a better way to support the developers, rather than risking our own miner stability. By using the official Claymore I lost about 4% of my shares compared to using the Claymore without the Developer Fee, everyone can try it for themselves and see the difference.
